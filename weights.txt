The non-large types (i.e., those with size below 1/2) are the same for all values of k.
For each type i, we give the following information below:
	- lower bound of the size, i.e., t_{i+1}
	- the blue weight, which is (1-red_i)/bluefit_i
	- the red weight, which is red_i/redfit_i
	- the maximum weight (which is the sum of the two weights)
	- the value leaves_i
	- the value needs_i
	- the weight used in the knapsack problem; several weights are given for different ranges of k
Please note that rational numbers are given as rounded decimals for sake of readability.
Exact values can be found in the file knapsackData.txt.
K=396. The case that k=K+1 thus is the case k=397.
