### ExtremeHarmonicVerifier program

We provide our executable program as a .jar-file, we require that [Java8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) is installed on your machine. This is a command-line based tool and lacks graphical user interface. To execute our program, open your command-line, navigate to the directory containing the .jar-file and execute `java -jar ExtremeHarmonicVerifier.jar` to start the program.
